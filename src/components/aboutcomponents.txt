Components:-
A Component is one of the 
core building blocks of React. In other
words, we can say that every application
you will develop in React will be made up 
of pieces called components. Components make the
task of building UIs much easier. You can see a 
UI broken down into multiple individual pieces 
called components and work on them independently 
and merge them all in a parent component which will be your final UI.
Components can be nested inside one another

=> we mainly have two types of components: 
1. functional component
2. class component

both of them are explained and implemented
in components folder
