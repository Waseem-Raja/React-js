PROPS:-
the props are a type of object
where the value of attributes of a tag is stored.

props are Read-only || immutable
i.e we can modfiy or change a value in props object
that's why we say
All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.
here pure  functions means which can't alter their inputs
they will provide same output  for the same input always

//well we can say its a limitation or you know behaviour
or properties of props.
