//to overcome the immutablity of  props we use state
//so that we can make changes dynamically in a component
State is just like props not actually
but its also an object which is contained in a
component rather then passing to component just like props
=> a state holds information and that information may 
change over the life time of 
that component
=> they are just like variables decleard in the function  body
=> in class component we can acess them using this.varname;
and in functional component we use "useState hook"
